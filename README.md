The Bittensor CLI, `btcli`, is a powerful command line tool for the Bittensor platform. You can use it on any macOS, Linux or WSL terminal to manage all common operations like creating a wallet, registering a subnet or a neuron, delegating your TAO, viewing Senate proposals and voting for them, and much more. Help information can be invoked for every command and option with `--help` option.

## Documentation

Installation steps are described below. For a full documentation on how to use `btcli`, see the [Bittensor CLI section](https://docs.bittensor.com/btcli) on the developer documentation site.

---

## Install on macOS and Linux

You can install `btcli` on your local machine directly from source, or from PyPI. **Make sure you verify your installation after you install**:


### Install from PyPI

Run 
```
pip install -U bittensor-cli
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):
```
uv pip install bittensor-cli
```

### Install from source

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv btcli_venv
source btcli_venv/bin/activate
```

2. Clone the Bittensor CLI repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/btcli.git
```

3. `cd` into `btcli` directory.

```bash
cd btcli
```

4.  Install


```bash
pip3 install .
```

### Also install bittensor (SDK)

If you prefer to install the btcli alongside the bittensor SDK, you can do this in a single command with

```
pip install -U bittensor[cli]
```

---

## Install on Windows

To install and run Bittensor SDK on Windows you must install [**WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) on Windows and select [Ubuntu Linux distribution](https://github.com/ubuntu/WSL/blob/main/docs/guides/install-ubuntu-wsl2.md). 

After you installed the above, follow the same installation steps described above in [Install on macOS and Linux](#install-on-macos-and-linux).

**ALERT**: **Limited support on Windows for Bittensor operations**
While wallet transactions like delegating, transfer, registering, staking can be performed on a Windows machine using WSL 2, the subnet mining and subnet validating operations are not recommended and are not supported on Windows machines.

---

## Verify the installation

```bash
btcli --version
```

The above command will show you the version of the `btcli` you just installed.

---

## Configuration

You can set the commonly used values, such as your hotkey and coldkey names, the default chain URL or the network name you use, and more, in `config.yml`. You can override these values by explicitly passing them in the command line for any `btcli` command.

### Example config file

The default location of the config file is: `~/.bittensor/config.yml`. An example of a `config.yml` is shown below:

```yaml
chain: ws://127.0.0.1:9945
network: local
no_cache: False
wallet_hotkey: hotkey-user1
wallet_name: coldkey-user1
wallet_path: ~/.bittensor/wallets
metagraph_cols:
  ACTIVE: true
  AXON: true
  COLDKEY: true
  CONSENSUS: true
  DIVIDENDS: true
  EMISSION: true
  HOTKEY: true
  INCENTIVE: true
  RANK: true
  STAKE: true
  TRUST: true
  UID: true
  UPDATED: true
  VAL: true
  VTRUST: true
```

**For more help:**

```bash
btcli config --help
```
